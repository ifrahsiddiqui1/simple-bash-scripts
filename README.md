Project 1 – Simple Bash Scripts

This project is based on the repository Simple Bash Scripts
.

Steps I Followed

I forked the repository, which copied it to my own GitHub account.

I cloned my forked repository into Kali Linux using:

git clone https://github.com/ifrahsiddiqui1/simple-bash-scripts.git


I checked that the repository was cloned successfully by using the ls command.

Inside the cloned folder, I found a scripts directory containing more than 50 executable files.

I explored and ran several of the scripts to see how they work.

Scripts I Tested

hello-world.sh → printed Hello World.

addition.sh → asked me for two numbers and displayed their sum.

factorial.sh → asked me for a number and returned its factorial (e.g., factorial of 3 = 6).

interactive.sh → asked my name and said goodbye, showing interactive input/output.

collectnetworkinfo.sh → required root access; after running with sudo su, it saved system network info to a .txt file.

lowercase.sh → converted uppercase input into lowercase.

random-emoji.sh → displayed random emojis.

Environment

OS: Kali Linux

Tools Used: Git, Bash shell, sudo

Conclusion

This project helped me understand how Bash scripts can automate tasks, perform calculations, and interact with the user. I explored multiple scripts from the repo and tested them successfully in Kali Linux.
